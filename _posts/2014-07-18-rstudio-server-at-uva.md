title: RStudio Server at UVA
---

The Bioinformatics Core and the Health Sciences Library have teamed up to launch RStudio Server at UVA! RStudio Server lets you use RStudio right in your web browser, giving you the power and productivity of the RStudio environment with the back-end R session running on our high-performance production server. You can even connect your browser-based RStudio session to your [UVA Box](http://virginia.box.com/) account, giving you 50 GB of free storage space.

Check out the screenshot below - it has the same look and feel of the RStudio you know and love, but it's actually running from your web browser! This enables you to access a consistent R environment from any computer with web access.

Speak with Stephen Turner in the [Bioinformatics Core](http://bioinformatics.virginia.edu) to get set up.
