title: "RNA-seq Bootcamp November 10, 2014: Registration open"
---

Registration is open for the RNA-seq data analysis bootcamp. Click the link below and scroll down to find the "Register" button, or use `Ctrl-F` in your browser and search for `RNA-seq Data Analysis Bootcamp`.

**Registration**: <https://cmetracker.net/UVACME/Catalog>

**Date**: Monday, November 10, 2014  
**Time**: 8:00 am (sharp!) - 5:00 pm  
**Location**: Carter classroom, first floor Health Sciences Library

This workshop is directed toward life scientists with little to no experience with statistical computing or bioinformatics. This interactive workshop will introduce both the Linux/UNIX operating system and the R statistical computing environment, with a focus on a biological application - analyzing RNA-seq data for differentially expressed genes. The morning session will introduce basic operation in a UNIX environment, and will cover the first steps in an RNA-seq analysis including QC, alignment, and quantitation. The afternoon will introduce the R statistical computing environment, and will cover differential gene expression analysis using Bioconductor. By the end of the workshop, participants will:

0. Be familiar with the UNIX shell, including nagivating the filesystem, creating/examining/removing files, getting help, and batch operations.
0. Know how to align and quantitate gene expression with RNA-seq data/
0. Become familiar with the R statistical computing environment, including data types, variables, array manipulation, functions, data frames, data import/export, visualization, and using packages.
0. Know what packages to use and what steps to take to analyze RNA-seq data for differentially expressed genes.

Participants will also be exposed to operating in a virtual environment and/or provisioning their own cloud computing resources. This course is sponsored by the Claude Moore Health Sciences Library.

**Preliminary Agenda**

***The workshop will start promptly at 8:00am***. If you have any trouble with setup, please contact Stephen Turner prior to the course. Dr. Turner will also be available 30 minutes prior to the course for hands-on troubleshooting, but please try to solve any setup problems prior to this time if possible.
