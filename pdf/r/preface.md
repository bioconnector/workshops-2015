\chapter*{Preface}

This document contains material from several workshops directed toward life scientists with little to no experience with statistical computing or bioinformatics.

The first part of the workshop introduces the R statistical computing environment, including basic instruction in data types, variables, array manipulation, functions, data frames, data import/export, visualization, and using packages.

The next section covers data cleaning and "tidy data," and introduces R packages that enable data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using split-apply-combine strategies. Upon completing this lesson, participants will be able to use the dplyr package in R to effectively manipulate and conditionally compute summary statistics over subsets of a "big" dataset containing many observations.

Thhe next section covers fundamental concepts for creating effective data visualization and introduces tools and techniques for visualizing large, high-dimensional data using R. We review fundamental concepts for visually displaying quantitative information, such as using series of small multiples, avoiding "chart-junk," and maximizing the data-ink ratio. After briefly covering data visualization using base R graphics, we introduce the ggplot2 package for advanced high-dimensional visualization. We cover the grammar of graphics (geoms, aesthetics, stats, and faceting), and using ggplot2 to create plots layer-by-layer. Upon completing this lesson, learners will be able to use ggplot2 to explore a high-dimensional dataset by faceting and scaling scatter plots in small multiples.

The final section is a live demonstration of a real biomedical application - analysis of publicly available RNA-seq data. This demonstrates (1) how to acquire publicly accessible data from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus, and (2) how to use Bioconductor packages to import, process, QC, analyze, and visualize the results of the analysis. By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to use R for basic data manipulation and visualization, and will know where to look for further help and instruction. Participants will also be exposed to analyzing RNA-seq data. An advanced follow-on course will go through a gene expression data analysis in detail. This course is sponsored by the Claude Moore Health Sciences Library.
