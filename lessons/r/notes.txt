This section was used in the r-deseq-demo to show how to install and load packages. Probably don't need any more.

## Install and load packages

First, we'll need to install some add-on packages. Most generic R packages are hosted on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN, <http://cran.us.r-project.org/>). To install one of these packages, you would use `install.packages("packagename")`. You only need to install a package once, then load it each time using `library(packagename)`. Let's install the **dplyr** package.

```{r install_packages, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
```

Bioconductor packages work a bit differently, and are not hosted on CRAN. Go to <http://bioconductor.org/> to learn more about the Bioconductor project. To use any Bioconductor package, you'll need a few "core" Bioconductor packages. Run the following commands to (1) download the installer script, and (2) install some core Bioconductor packages. You'll need internet connectivity to do this, and it'll take a few minutes, but it only needs to be done once.

```{r bioclite, eval=FALSE}
# Download the installer script
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")

# biocLite() is the bioconductor installer function. Run it without any
# arguments to install the core packages or update any installed packages. This
# requires internet connectivity and will take some time!
biocLite()
```

To install specific packages, first download the installer script if you haven't done so, and use `biocLite("packagename")`. This only needs to be done once then you can load the package like any other package. Let's download the [DESeq2 package](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html):

```{r load_deseq2, eval=FALSE}
# Do only once
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("DESeq2")
```

Now let's load the packages we'll use:

```{r load_pkgs, warning=FALSE}
library(DESeq2)
```
