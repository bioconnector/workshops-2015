# About

This website contains all the documentation and course materials for Stephen Turner's bioinformatics workshops. The source code for this website is on [GitHub](https://github.com/bioconnector/workshops). If you're looking for further bioinformatics training, workshops, and other resources, I keep a list [here](http://stephenturner.us/edu).
