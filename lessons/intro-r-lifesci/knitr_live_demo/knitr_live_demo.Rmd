## Formatting

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring documents. Text you type here will appear as text in the report that's produced. 

Formatting is easy. This is **bold text**, this is *italic text*, and this is `fixed-width text`. 

* This is a bulleted list.
  * This is a sub-bullet
  * Another sub-bullet
* This is another bullet.

Create blockquotes with the ">" character: 

> IT WAS the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way- in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

## Embedding R code inside a document.

This is a "chunk" of R code. The code is actually run, and the results are printed to the output.

```{r}
chromstats <- read.table("chromstats.txt", header=TRUE)
chromstats
summary(chromstats)
```

We're back in plain text world here. 

You can also embed plots, for example, let's make a bar plot of chromosome lengths. Note that chromosome 23 and 24 represent the X and Y chromosomes, respectively:

```{r barplot, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Bar plot of Chromosome Lengths"}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(chr, length, geom="bar", data=chromstats, stat="identity", main="Chromosome lengths")
```

Now let's make a scatterplot of the number of SNPs on each chromosome versus the chromosome's length:

```{r scatterplot, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Scatter plot of SNPs vs Chromosome Length"}
p <- qplot(length, variations, data=chromstats, main="Number of SNPs vs. Chromosome Length") 
p + geom_smooth(method="loess")
```
