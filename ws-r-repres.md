# Reproducible Reporting: Generating Dynamic Documents with R+RStudio

Contemporary life science is plagued by reproducibility issues. This workshop covers some of the barriers to reproducible research and how to start to address some of those problems during the data management and analysis phases of the research life cycle. In this workshop we will cover using R and dynamic document generation with RMarkdown and RStudio to weave together reporting text with executable R code to automatically generate reports in the form of PDF, Word, or HTML documents.

**Date**: September 29, 2015  
**Time**: 1:00pm - 5:00pm  
**Location**: Health Sciences Library, Carter Classroom

**Pre-requisites:**
