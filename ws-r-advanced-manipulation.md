# Advanced Data Manipulation with R

Data analysis involves a large amount of [janitor work](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html) - munging and cleaning data to facilitate downstream data analysis. This workshop is designed for those with a basic familiarity with R who want to learn tools and techniques for advanced data manipulation. It will cover data cleaning and "tidy data," and will introduce participants to R packages that enable data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using split-apply-combine strategies. Upon completing this lesson, participants will be able to use the dplyr package in R to effectively manipulate and conditionally compute summary statistics over subsets of a "big" dataset containing many observations.

**Date**: Feb 26, 2015  
**Time**: 9:00am - 11:00am  
**Location**: Health Sciences Library, Carter Classroom

**Pre-requisites:**

* This is not a beginner course. This workshop requires basic familiarity with R: data types including vectors and data frames, importing/exporting data, and plotting. You can refresh your R knowledge with [DataCamp's Intro to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-r) or [TryR from CodeSchool](http://tryr.codeschool.com/).
* Bring a laptop to the course with the software installed as detailed below.

## Before coming

You must bring a laptop with the necessary software installed to the course. Please install the software below *prior to the course* - we will not have time during the workshop to troubleshoot installation issues.
