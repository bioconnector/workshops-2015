# Advanced Data Visualization with R and ggplot2

This workshop will cover fundamental concepts for creating effective data visualization and will introduce tools and techniques for visualizing large, high-dimensional data using R. We will review fundamental concepts for visually displaying quantitative information, such as using series of small multiples, avoiding "chart-junk," and maximizing the data-ink ratio. After briefly covering data visualization using base R graphics, we will introduce the ggplot2 package for advanced high-dimensional visualization. We will cover the grammar of graphics (geoms, aesthetics, stats, and faceting), and using ggplot2 to create plots layer-by-layer. Upon completing this lesson, learners will be able to use ggplot2 to explore a high-dimensional dataset by faceting and scaling scatter plots in small multiples.

**Date**: March 2, 2015  
**Time**: 2:00pm - 4:00pm  
**Location**: Health Sciences Library, Carter Classroom

**Pre-requisites:**

* This is not a beginner course. This workshop requires basic familiarity with R: data types including vectors and data frames, importing/exporting data, and plotting. You can refresh your R knowledge with [DataCamp's Intro to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-r) or [TryR from CodeSchool](http://tryr.codeschool.com/).
* This course also requires some experience with data manipulation using dplyr functions. If you already know some R, you can learn the basics of dplyr by spending 10 minutes with [the dplyr vignette](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html).
* Bring a laptop to the course with the software installed as detailed below.
